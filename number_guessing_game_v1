# Number Guessing Game V1 - From Scratch, By Myself
# This is a complete first draft.
# Script picks 1 random number, then has player guess.
# Currently, there are unlimited guesses.
# Next Version: Limit # of guesses, have it say 'only numbers' if letter is entered.
# Other ideas: Make computer_choice 2 digits or longer, Add computer hints.
