# Simple Calculator Exercise

Followed tutorial IOT to learn tkinter for Graphic User Interface skill building
Tutorial built simple calculator

Conducted calculator exercise to adjust the way it looks and add some elements of my own. 
First, tried to add "." to make the calculator use decimals. Was not able to figure that out, an issue with whole numbers maybe?
Second, tried to add "square root", I believe IOT do so i'd have to write out the equation in the code. 

Finally, implemented a "back" button. This allows you to remove the numbers you've entered but keep the previous selections.
Last note: Mac doesn't support background colors on buttons, apparently.
