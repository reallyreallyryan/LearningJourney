#BJJ Sub Mission.

Working to learn Python through courses online, tutorials, and projects.
I developed a script that will ask you whether what type of BJJ you're doing.
Then, script will choose a random sub and position based off of your choice.
Script will then continue to ask you if you completed it and want to keep trying. 

Future possible updates: 
-Create visual app for this program.
-Remove the submissions from the list if successful, until no more remain and you 'win'
